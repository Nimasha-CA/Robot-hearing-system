# Robot-hearing-system

For this robotâ€™s hearing system, two microphones are used. The direction of the sound source can be estimated using the Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) between two microphones and the characteristics of the sound. Here, only two microphones are used with some important assumptions. Cross-correlation is used to find TDOA. Speech recognition with Google web speech API is used to recognize the trigger word.
